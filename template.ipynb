        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The parking garage problem is currently structured to assume that demand is deterministic and constant. This is not representative of real world conditions as demand is highly dynamic and will change in response to various city conditions. For our final project, we want to better capture the variance in demand for parking, particularly in Houston. \n",
        "We will explore through research the relationship between price of parking and the demand of parking to implement into our get_action function. We will mathematically represent this relationship through a equation derived from our research. \n",
        "We will be considering the case where we are taking yearly time steps to represent a garage that rents out spots on a yearly basis. At the end of each year, we will evaluate whether demand of that year given the elasticity of demand, exceeds capacity enough to justify building an additional level. We will analyze this case for multiple demand vs. price curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Demand is a quantifiable variable for many cases outsid eof parking that determine whether a given action will be taken. By more accurately modeling this relationship between how the price of *something* might change the demand of it, and therefore the construction that might take place as a result, we can apply this to other climate scenarios that would require sequential decision making. For example, the decision to expand a solar farm on a an annual basis dependent on the demand of the energy for the clients it serve. \n",

        "## Selected Feature\n",
        "\n",
        "Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing decision-support tool.\n",

        "\n",
        "Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your chosen feature.\n",

        "## Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.\n",

        "\n",
        "As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.\n",
        "To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.\n",
        "Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.\n",

        "\n",
        "Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.\n",
        "Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.\n",
        "Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.\n",
        "Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.\n",
        "You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.\n",
